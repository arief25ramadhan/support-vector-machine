# Support Vector Machine

## Definition

Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm is used to find a separating line/hyperplane between data of different classes. The SVM maximizes the distance to the nearest point of each classes. This distance that we maximize is called a margin, when we maximize the margin we increase the robustness of the classification. 
SVM is a <strong>Supervised Learning</strong> algorithm.
